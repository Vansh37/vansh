        int num1 = 10;
        int num2 = 5;

        System.out.println("Addition of two numbers: " + (num1 + num2));
        System.out.println("Subtraction of two numbers: " + (num1 - num2));
        System.out.println("Multiplication of two numbers: " + (num1 * num2));
        System.out.println("Division of two numbers: " + (num1 / num2));
    }
}
